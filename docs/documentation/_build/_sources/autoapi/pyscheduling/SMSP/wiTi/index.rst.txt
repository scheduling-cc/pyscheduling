.. py:class:: wiTi_Instance(n: int, name: str = 'Unknown', **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pyscheduling.SMSP.SingleMachine.SingleInstance`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

.. py:class:: WSPT

   Bases: :py:obj:`pyscheduling.core.base_solvers.BaseSolver`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. py:method:: solve(instance: wiTi_Instance)

      WSPT rule is efficient if the due dates are too tight (for overdue jobs)

      :param instance: Instance to be solved
      :type instance: wiTi_Instance

      :returns: SolveResult of the instance by the method
      :rtype: RootProblem.SolveResult



.. py:class:: MS

   Bases: :py:obj:`pyscheduling.core.base_solvers.BaseSolver`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. py:method:: solve(instance: wiTi_Instance)

      MS rule is efficient if the due dates are too loose (for not overdue jobs)

      :param instance: Instance to be solved
      :type instance: wiTi_Instance

      :returns: SolveResult of the instance by the method
      :rtype: RootProblem.SolveResult



.. py:class:: ACT

   Bases: :py:obj:`pyscheduling.core.base_solvers.BaseSolver`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. py:method:: solve(instance: wiTi_Instance)

      Appearant Cost Tardiness rule balances between WSPT and MS rules based on due dates tightness and range

      :param instance: Instance to be solved
      :type instance: wiTi_Instance

      :returns: SolveResult of the instance by the method
      :rtype: RootProblem.SolveResult


   .. py:method:: ACT_Tuning(instance: wiTi_Instance)

      Analyze the instance to consequently tune the ACT. For now, the tuning is static.

      :param instance: Instance tackled by ACT heuristic
      :type instance: riwiTi_Instance

      :returns: K
      :rtype: int, int
